Wanted Variants List: Add multiple "acceptable" outcomes to see your combined chance of hitting any of them.

Resource Preparation Guide: * Calculates exact material and gold requirements.

Provides confidence benchmarks: 50% (Median), 63.2% (Theoretical), 80% (Likely), and 99% (Safe).

Live Roll Simulator: Test your luck with a real-time simulator that tracks total rolls, gold burned, and "Close Hits" (matching stats but lower values).

📈 How to Use
Select your Item Type and choose your desired Substats.

Add to Wanted Variants to build a list of gear pieces you'd be happy with.

Check the Prep Guide to see how many materials you should save up before you start rolling.
