🚀 Spirit Vale: Probability Calculator


I’ve always really liked probability, so I built this tool to help the community plan gear rolls and manage materials more effectively.


🛠 What it does

Smart Odds: Automatically calculates your chances, accounting for stat exclusions (e.g., you won't see ATK and MATK together).

Wanted List: Add multiple "win" conditions to see your combined chance of hitting any of them.

Prep Guide: Shows exactly how many materials and gold you need based on different confidence levels (50%, 63.2%, 80%, and 99%).

Simulator: Run a "test roll" to see how the RNG behaves before you spend your real resources.


How to use it:

Select your Item Type and desired Substats.

Click Add to Wanted Variants.

Check the Prep Guide to see your estimated costs.

Use the Roll Simulator to see a live breakdown of rolls and gold.

Enjoy! 🥂
